[Project 2: Research on companies on Yelp]

  In this project, I did some analysis and i made inferences based on some particular questions using SQLite.
  
  Firstly, I did some preprocessing to have good understanding of the dataset. 
  then I compared the difference between business with high star rating and business with low star rating.
  then I predicted the major reasons why some businesses close down by comparing closed and active business.
  Lastly, I analyze the star rating and number of reviews to know popular food companies in Yelp.
